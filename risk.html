    <h1>Important Risk Information about $PEPOL required by UK law</h1>

    <p><strong>$PEPOL</strong> is a meme cryptocurrency token built for entertainment and community purposes. The UK FCA tightened crypto promotion rules in 2023-2024 because of massive consumer losses during the 2021-22 bullrun and crash.
    The FCA mainly target scammy coins, fake staking platforms, high-pressure tactics, and misleading ads but it is required to outline the risks of crypto to all:</p>

    <p>Investing in cryptocurrencies involves a high level of risk. The value of $PEPOL (or any other crypto assset) may fluctuate significantly and you could lose all the money you invest.</p>

    <p>There is no compensation scheme (such as the Financial Services Compensation Scheme) available if something goes wrong.</p>

    <p><strong>$PEPOL</strong> is not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or any other financial regulator.</p>

    <p>Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.</p>

    <p>Buying, selling, or holding $PEPOL may have tax consequences. You are responsible for your own tax reporting and compliance.</p>

    <p>Cryptoassets can be highly volatile and may become illiquid.</p>

    <p>You should only invest what you can afford to lose.</p>
